this is a simple tool that can solve any wordle. <br/>
all it really does is filter the words based on the clues you
give it.

## Usage

`git clone` the repo, `go install` and enjoy :) <br/>

call `wrdl` and start typing in your clues, and you can view the possible wordle words.

`space` lets u cycle between the letter being grey, yellow, and green.
